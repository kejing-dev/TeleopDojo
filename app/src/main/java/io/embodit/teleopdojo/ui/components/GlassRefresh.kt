/**
 * Keeps a glass panel's backdrop fresh (ported from Qianliyan, QA round 2 q2-1).
 *
 * `backgroundMaterial` is a property of the panel's graphics layer: the backdrop is composited into the
 * panel's frame when that layer is drawn. On the emulator a frame drawn before the backdrop is ready comes
 * up black over the region that frame repainted (a static panel shows a black band),
 * and a static panel never draws again, so the black stayed until the card was hidden. The call strip
 * recovered from the same black frame within a second or two because its live dot redraws all the time.
 *
 * Put this right after `backgroundMaterial(...)`: it re-records the material layer a few times after the panel is
 * composed (0.7, 1.5, 3, 6, 10 s) and then stops. Drone Sight: a refresh every 500 ms on two panels kept the
 * 1-fps emulator's render thread busy enough for the runtime watchdog to kill it (build.log 2026-10-31).
